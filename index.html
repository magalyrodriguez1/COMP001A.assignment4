    <h1>Home page - Space</h1>
    <p>Space is something intriguing and inspires us due to its uncertainty.
        Its emptiness and its vastness is something that many of us have
        a hard time imagining especially as the universe expands every second, with
        every thought, every conversation, every mundane task one may perform.
        My inspiration for making this site was to spread awareness about our beautiful space,
        and to show how lucky we are to be living right now on the only planet that we for
        sure know of that can host life.</p>

    <h2>Our solar system</h2>
        <p>As we know, our solar system is made up of 8 planets, our sun, and Pluto.
        And we know for sure that the other planets can not be lived on. At least,
        not our kind. The reason for this being is that our solar system is made up of 
        mostly gas giants. This includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. What 
        being a gas giant means is that the planet is essentially a big ball of gas. 
        These planets do not have a "surface", or rather their surface is their core. </p>

        <p>So, if we were to end up on these planets, we would just continue going through the planet 
        and feeling the immense pressure (think about the ocean and how the atmosphere increases the 
        further down we go) until we hit the core. So now we are only down to 4 planets and Pluto.</p> 
    
         <p>It is not possible to live on Mars. This is the unfortunate truth. Well, unless you wouldn't 
        mind living in a space suit for the rest of your life. The reason why Mars hosts no life, despite it being a good
        distance from the sun, is due to its atmosphere. Something happened within Mars' core 
        which caused its atmosphere to slowly disappear. This could have been due to the Sun's radiation being too strong for 
        Mars and Mars atmosphere could not take it. Sorry for opinions but I am upset because it would have been
        awesome to have been possibly been able to travel and live on Mars without a space suit. 
        Below is an image of mars, venus, and earth a few billion years ago.</p>

        <p>Maybe it was a possibility that life forms were starting to form these billion years ago, 
            but I think it is fair to assume that their fate was met. Venus is scorching hot because of 
            its distance to the Sun. Not just because of its distance, but because of its thick atmosphere.
            Sadly we got unlucky because imagine if Venus and Mars could have switched places. Either way, 
            Mars' fate was obvious. Now, this is just me ranting because sure we didn't hit the lottery with 
            3 habitable planets but 2 could have been cool too. However Mars decided it should be farther even
            though its atmosphere got stripped of.

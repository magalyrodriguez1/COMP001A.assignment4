    <h1>Nebulae</h1>

    <h2>Nebulae Facts</h2>

        <p>Nebulae are huge areas of dust and gas that can span many light years. They are called stellar nurseries,
            because this is where many stars are born, just like our own Sun. These spectacular areas of space look absolutely
            stunning and often look very different from each other.
        </p>

        <p>The closest known nebula is the Helix Nebula, sitting at 700 light years away from Earth. It is very far away, yet because of how big 
            they can be, we can see them in high quality.

    <p>One of the most popular nebula is the Pillars of Creation, a part that is within the Eagle Nebula. It is famous for 
        looking like a sort of mythical creature, very majestic. I am definitely biased in saying it is my favorite because of how 
        it looks plus the colors captured by the James Webb telescope makes it look fantastic.

    <h2>Where do Nebulae come from?</h2>

    <p>Nebulae come from dying stars, also known as supernova. Once a dying star explodes, it releases hot gas and dust everywhere. The explosion
        can be so big, that we can even capture it. Currently, we are awaiting for the supernova of Betelgeuse, which is located ~650 light years 
        from Earth. Once it does go supernova, we will be able to see it in the night sky for MONTHS. Hopefully in our lifetimes!

    <p>One extremely recent supernova happened in the Pinwheel galaxy, in which an amateur astro-photographer captured it!
        Note: Pinwheel galaxy is 20 million light years away from Earth. </p>

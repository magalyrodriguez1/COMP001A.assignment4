    <h1>The Milky Way Galaxy - Our Home</h1>

    <h2>Milky Way?</h2>

    <p>Sometime in school we have learned we live in a galaxy called the Milky Way Galaxy. But what is a galaxy? Which part 
        are we in? Where are we? Well first, we can see a render of our galaxy. We can also see where in our galaxy we are 
        located in. Although our solar system is no where nearly as big, we at least have an idea as to where we are.
         We do not have a real photo of it because not only are we inside of it but it spans 100,000 light years 
         (the farthest anything manmade has gone to is not even ONE light day away!) So now you can imagine 
         the distance of one light year. (which is 5,878,625,370,000 miles... insane) 

         (reference: Earth is part of the Solar System, which is in the Milky Way Galaxy.)

    <p>Anyway, a galaxy is typically made up of a supermassive black hole (ours is named Sagittarius A*) and is surrounded by
        gas and dust clouds... That is the fundamentals of it, but these gas and dust clouds are what create stars and planets.
    Also, do not worry about us being eaten by our own black hole... not only is it too far away, it is also being surrounded by too
    much material to consume. </p>

    <h2>Is it possible to see it? At all?</h2>
        <p>Although we cannot see the Milky Way in its entirety from Earth we can at least have the opportunity to see an arm
            of it. This spiral arm is the Orion-Cygnus Arm and we are in this same arm, just at the inner edge of it. Below
            you can see an exposure shot of the arm (basically, you cannot see this with your own eyes. Only the camera can
            pick it up)
        </p>

  <p>If we were to go to a place on Earth that has little to no light pollution, we would be able to see a version of this 
    picture. We wouldn't see the bright center just as bright, but we would still be able to see something. It is very
    difficult nowadays to see it due to so much lights at night, which is a shame considering what a beauty there is every 
    night.
